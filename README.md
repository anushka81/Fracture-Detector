# 🩺 Fracture Detection with Detection Transformer (DETR)  

This project demonstrates how to use the **Detection Transformer (DETR)** for custom object detection, specifically for detecting fractures in medical images like X-rays and CT scans. 🚑  

The code leverages the **DETR** model, which combines transformers with convolutional networks for end-to-end object detection.

## 🔍 Overview  

DETR (Detection Transformer) is a cutting-edge object detection architecture introduced by Facebook Research. Unlike traditional methods, DETR uses transformers in both the backbone and detection head, enabling direct object detection without relying on complex heuristics.  

In this project, we apply DETR for **fracture detection** to classify and locate fractures in medical images.

## 🛠️ Installation  

Follow these steps to set up the project:  

```bash  
# Upgrade pip  
python -m pip install --upgrade pip  

# Install dependencies  
pip install supervision==0.3.0  
pip install transformers  
pip install pytorch-lightning  
pip install timm  
pip install cython  
pip install pycocotools  
pip install scipy  
```  

---

## ⚙️ Project Setup  

1. Clone the repository or download the code.  
2. Prepare your custom dataset (images of fractures and non-fractures).  
3. Fine-tune the DETR model on your dataset using the instructions below.  

---

## 📖 How It Works  

1. **Pretrained Model**: The base model is DETR, pretrained on the COCO dataset. You’ll fine-tune it on a custom fracture dataset.  
2. **Custom Dataset**: Use labeled images with bounding boxes around fractures. The dataset should follow the COCO format or be converted to it.  
3. **Fine-tuning**: Train DETR on your dataset to detect fractures in unseen images.

## 🚀 Fine-tuning DETR on a Custom Dataset  

Steps for fine-tuning:  

1. **Prepare the Data**: Format your dataset as COCO (JSON with bounding boxes).  
2. **Run Training**: Use the provided script to start training.  
3. **Evaluate Results**: Test the model on new images to validate its performance.

## 💻 Usage  

Once trained, you can use the model to detect fractures:  

```python  
from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection  
import torch  
from PIL import Image  

# Load the model and processor  
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")  
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")  

# Load an image  
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")  

# Preprocess the image  
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")  

# Perform object detection  
outputs = model(**inputs)  

# Post-process and visualize the results  
```
